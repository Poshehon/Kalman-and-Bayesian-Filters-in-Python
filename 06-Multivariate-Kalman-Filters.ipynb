    "We are now ready to study and implement the full, multivariate form of the Kalman filter. In the last chapter we learned how multivariate Gaussians express the correlation between multiple random variables, such as the position and velocity of an aircraft. We also learned how correlation between variables drastically improves the posterior. If we only roughly know position and velocity, but they are correlated, then our new estimate can be very accurate.\n",

    "I prefer that you develop an intuition for how these filters work through several worked examples. I'm going to gloss over many issues. Some things I show you will only work for special cases, others will be 'magical' - it will not be clear how I derived a certain result. If I started with rigorous, generalized equations you would be left scratching your head about what all these terms mean and how you might apply them to your problem. In later chapters I will provide a more rigorous mathematical foundation, and at that time I will have to either correct approximations that I made in this chapter or provide additional information that I did not cover here. \n",

An added benefit is that Newton's equations are the right equations to use to track moving objects, one of the main uses of Kalman filters."

For example, we could also track acceleration, or even jerk.

We will learn how the Kalman filter computes estimates for hidden variables later in this chapter. \n",

I use Newton's dot notation for derivatives; $\\dot x$ represents the first derivative of x with respect to t: $\\dot x = \\frac{dx}{dt}$.

    "There is still a lot to learn, but we have implemented a Kalman filter using the same theory and equations as published by Rudolf Kalman! Code very much like this runs inside of your GPS, airliners, robots, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first plot plots the output of the Kalman filter against the measurements and the actual position of our dog (labelled *Track*). After the initial settling in period the filter should track the dog's position very closely. The yellow shaded portion between the black dotted lines shows 1 standard deviations of the filter's variance, which I explain in the next paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two plots show the variance of $x$ and of $\\dot x$. I have plotted the diagonals of $\\mathbf P$ over time. Recall that the diagonal of a covariance matrix contains the variance of each state variable. So $\\mathbf P[0,0]$ is the variance of $x$, and $\\mathbf P[1,1]$ is the variance of $\\dot x$. You can see that we quickly converge to small variances for both. \n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance matrix $\\mathbf P$ tells us the *theoretical* performance of the filter *assuming* everything we tell it is true. Recall that the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and that approximately 68% of a Gaussian distribution occurs within one standard deviation. If at least 68% of the filter output is within one standard deviation  the filter may be performing well. In the top chart I have displayed the one standard deviation as the yellow shaded area between the two dotted lines. To my eye it looks like perhaps the filter is slightly exceeding that bounds, so the filter probably needs some tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the univariate chapter we filtered very noisy signals with much simpler code than the code above. However, realize that right now we are working with a very simple example - an object moving through 1-D space and one sensor. That is about the limit of what we can compute with the code in the last chapter. In contrast, we can implement very complicated, multidimensional filters with this code merely by altering our assignments to the filter's variables. Perhaps we want to track 100 dimensions in financial models. Or we have an aircraft with a GPS, INS, TACAN, radar altimeter, baro altimeter, and airspeed indicator, and we want to integrate all those sensors into a model that predicts position, velocity, and acceleration in 3D space. We can do that with the code in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want you to get a better feel for how the Gaussians change over time, so here is a 3D plot showing the Gaussians every 7th epoch (time step). Every 7th separates them enough so can see each one independently. The first Gaussian at $t=0$ is to the left."

We start with the covariance $\\mathbf P=(\\begin{smallmatrix}20&0\\\\0&20\\end{smallmatrix})$, which signifies a lot of uncertainty about our initial belief. After we receive the first measurement the Kalman filter updates this belief, and so the variance is no longer as large. In the top plot the first ellipse (the one on the far left) should be a slightly squashed ellipse. As the filter continues processing the measurements the covariance ellipse quickly shifts shape until it settles down to being a long, narrow ellipse tilted in the direction of movement.\n",

    "The x-axis is for position, and y-axis is velocity. An ellipse that is vertical, or nearly so, says there is no correlation between position and velocity, and an ellipse that is diagonal says that there is a lot of correlation. Phrased that way, the results sound unlikely. The tilt of the ellipse changes, but the correlation shouldn't be changing over time. But this is a measure of the *output of the filter*, not a description of the actual, physical world. When $\\mathbf R$ is very large we are telling the filter that there is a lot of noise in the measurements. In that case the Kalman gain $\\mathbf K$ is set to favor the prediction over the measurement, and the prediction comes from the velocity state variable. Thus there is a large correlation between $x$ and $\\dot x$. Conversely, if $\\mathbf R$ is small, we are telling the filter that the measurement is very trustworthy, and $\\mathbf K$ is set to favor the measurement over the prediction. Why would the filter want to use the prediction if the measurement is nearly perfect? If the filter is not using much from the prediction there will be very little correlation reported. \n",

    "\n",
    "Multivariate Gaussians allow us to simultaneously handle multiple dimensions, both spacial and others (velocity, etc). We made a key insight: hidden variables have the ability to significantly increase the accuracy of the filter. This is possible because the hidden variables are correlated with the observed variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "I gave an intuitive definition of *observability*. Observability was invented by Dr. Kalman for linear systems, and there is a fair amount of theory behind it. It answers the question of whether a system state can be determined by observing the system's output. For our problems this has been easy to determine, but more complicated systems may require rigorous analysis. Wikipedia's [Observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability) article has an overview; if you need to learn the topic [[2]](#References) is a good source. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one important caveat about hidden variables. It is easy to construct a filter that produces estimates for hidden variables. I could write a filter that estimates the color of a tracked car. But there is no way to compute car color from positions, so the estimate for the color will be nonsense. The designer must verify that these variables are being estimated correctly. If you do not have a velocity sensor and yet are estimating velocity, you will need to test that the velocity estimates are correct.; do not trust that they are. For example, suppose the velocity has a periodic component to it - it looks like a sine wave. If your sample time is less than 2 times the frequency you will not be able to accurately estimate the velocity (due to Nyquist's Theorem). Imagine that the sample period is equal to the frequency of the velocity. The filter will report that the velocity is constant because it samples the system at the same point on the sin wave. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization poses a particularly difficult problem for hidden variables. If you start with a bad initialization the filter can usually recover the observed variables, but may struggle and fail with the hidden one. Estimating hidden variables is a powerful tool, but a dangerous one. \n",
    "\n",
    "I established a series of steps for designing a Kalman filter. These are not a usual part of the Kalman filter literature, and are only meant as a guide, not a prescription. Designing for a hard problem is an iterative process. You make a guess at the state vector, work out what your measurement and state models are, run some tests, and then alter the design as necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The design of $\\mathbf R$ and $\\mathbf Q$ is often quite challenging. I've made it appear to be quite scientific. Your sensor has Gaussian noise of $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, so set $\\mathbf R=\\sigma^2$. Easy! This is a dirty lie. Sensors are not Gaussian. We started the book with a bathroom scale. Suppose $\\sigma=1$ kg, and you try to weigh something that weighs 0.5 kg. Theory tells us we will get negative measurements, but of course the scale will never report weights less than zero. Real world sensors typically have *fat tails* (known as *kurtosis*) and *skew*. In some cases, such as with the scale, one or both tails are truncated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case with $\\mathbf Q$ is more dire. I hope you were skeptical when I blithely assigned a noise matrix to my prediction about the movements of a dog. Who can say what a dog will do next? The Kalman filter in my GPS doesn't know about hills, the outside winds, or my terrible driving skills. Yet the filter requires a precise number to encapsulate all of that information, and it needs to work while I drive off-road in the desert, and when a Formula One champion drives on a track.\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems led some researchers and engineers to derogatorily call the Kalman filter a 'ball of mud'. In other words, it doesn't always hold together so well. Another term to know - Kalman filters can become *smug*. Their estimates are based solely on what you tell it the noises are. Those values can lead to overly confident estimates. $\\mathbf P$ gets smaller and smaller while the filter is actually becoming more and more inaccurate! In the worst case the filter diverges. We will see a lot of that when we start studying nonlinear filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman filter is a mathematical model of the world. The output is only as accurate as that model. To make the math tractable we had to make some assumptions. We assume that the sensors and motion model have Gaussian noise. We assume that everything is linear. If that is true, the Kalman filter is *optimal* in a least squares sense. This means that there is no way to make a better estimate than what the filter gives us. However, these assumption are almost never true, and hence the model is necessarily limited, and a working filter is rarely optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In later chapters we will deal with the problem of nonlinearity. For now I want you to understand that designing the matrices of a linear filter is an experimental procedure more than a mathematical one. Use math to establish the initial values, but then you need to experiment. If there is a lot of unaccounted noise in the world (wind, etc.) you may have to make $\\mathbf Q$ larger. If you make it too large the filter fails to respond quickly to changes. In the **Adaptive Filters** chapter you will learn some alternative techniques that allow you to change the filter design in real time in response to the inputs and performance, but for now you need to find one set of values that works for the conditions your filter will encounter. Noise matrices for an acrobatic plane might be different if the pilot is a student than if the pilot is an expert as the dynamics will be quite different."
